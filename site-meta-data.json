    "description": "Greetings everyone!! We the QC club have come up with our own blogging page.  The Quantum Computing club of IIIT Dharwad aspires to explore the dimensions and applications in Quantum.  We want to literate ourselves and our fellow students the scope of this newer branch. Till date our club has conducted a  workshop and plan to build a quantum simulation. Our motto is acknowledging quantum scopes and cryptography. So, what is actually Quantum Computing? There is a lot of abstractness around this term. In all the world of classical computers and codes this is a long run yet somewhat unexplored topic. Quantum Computing tackles with the properties and applications of quantum physics and quantum mechanics. Considering and functioning on the smallest unit of atom that is electron. QC is a classification that relies on properties of quantum states like superposition, interference and entanglement. This is a rapidly-emerging technology. The QC club blog is a channel to provide ingress into the Quantum dynamics. This blogging page aims to acquire interests and be go to page for all the enthusiasts. We have covered some basic yet important topics by far and aspire to come up with more advanced and interesting blogs very often. "
